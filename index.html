  <p>In recent years, many college students have wanted to help with efforts, 
    whether it be COVID-19 donations, hurricane relief efforts, 
    disease efforts, or helping with food drives. Still, most people 
    have no idea where to start. We at Volunteer U have created a user-friendly 
    website to make it easier to find and support relief efforts near U! In this 
    day and age, where everything is virtual, there are many opportunities for scammers 
    to take advantage of your kindness through fake charities or person-in-need scams. 
    Volunteer U serves as a middleman to connect students directly to service opportunities 
    in their communities. </p>
